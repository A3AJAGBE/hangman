## Project 7 - Hangman Game
This application is a basic hangman game, that selects a random word from a list of words and length of the word is showned in blanks to the user.
A user start's the game with 5 chances to guess the word correctly by guessing the letters in the word.
If the user guessed correctly before the chances is at 0 they win else they lose, while each wrong guess means the user loses a chance.
